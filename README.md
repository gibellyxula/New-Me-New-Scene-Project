# New-Me-New-Scene-Project
2025 Memories and 2026 Goals!
# Project: New Scene, New Me

## Introduction

Software engineers develop programs to create visual and audio experiences using object-oriented programming. As we begin 2026, your goal is to create an animation program that reflects on your experiences from 2025 and visualizes your goals and aspirations for the year ahead using the Theater and Scene API.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, algorithms, and the Theater/Scene API to create your animation program:
- **Write Scene subclasses** – Create two Scene subclasses: one to visualize your 2025 recap (LastYear) and another to project your 2026 goals (ThisYear). Each class must include both a no-argument constructor and a parameterized constructor.
- **Use private instance variables** – Implement proper encapsulation by declaring instance variables as private in your Scene subclasses.
- **Create 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store data for your scenes. One array must be created using an initializer list, and one array must be populated by reading from a text file using the FileReader class.
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs.
- **Access and modify array elements** – Use algorithms to traverse, access, and/or modify elements in your 1D arrays to display personalized content in your scenes.
- **Use logic and iteration** – Incorporate selection statements (if/if-else) and loops (while, for, or enhanced for) to control the flow and display of content in your scenes.
Incorporate variety of media – Use at least four different types of Scene API methods across both scenes (examples: drawImage(), drawText(), drawRectangle(), drawEllipse(), playSound(), setTextStyle(), setFillColor(), etc.).
- **Create a UML diagram** – Design a UML class diagram showing your Scene subclasses with their instance variables, constructors, and methods before you begin coding.
- **Document your code** – Use multi-line comments to explain the purpose of each method (including preconditions and postconditions) and single-line comments to explain code segments.

## UML Diagram 

Put an image of your UML Diagram here. Upload the image of your UML Diagram to your repository, then use the Markdown syntax to insert your image here. Make sure your image file name is one work, otherwise it might not properly get displayed on this README.

## Description of 2025 recap

Write a description of what you included in your 2025 recap scene (LastYear)

- The first image I included was a picture of the beach where I went with my friends. I love this picture because this memory is really special to me.
- The second image I included was a picture of a snowglobe from Chicago. I really liked the snowglobe and I have really good memories from Chicago as well!
- The third image I included was a picture of my friends and me at Target. We went to watch one of our favorite movies and went to the mall after so this memory is very special!
- The fourth image I included was a picture of my plane seat with the Karate Kid on it. The Karate Kid is one of my favorite movies, so I was excited to watch it on a plane!
- Lastly, the fifth photo I included was a picture of snowcones. This picture was when my family and I went to a church event and they gave us snowcones, which I thought was really fun!
## Description of 2026 goals

Write a description of what you included in your 2026 goals scene (ThisYear)
- The first image I included was of El Salvador. I have never been, I have family there, and would like to go soon!
- The second image I included was of a silhouette of a family. I chose this because I would love to spend more time with my family!
- The third image I included was of Guatemala. I haven't been to Guatemala in a few years and I would love to go back to visit my family!
- The fourth image I included was a picture of friends. This year I would like to make more friends or get to know new people!
- The last photo I chose was of a report card with straight A's because I would like to get straight A's again this semester!
