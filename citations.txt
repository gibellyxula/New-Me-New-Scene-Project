What I prompted:
- Can you explain this error to me: ThisYear.java:26: error: reached end of file while parsing
- I used past examples on code.org
- I used the starter code provided on Schoology
- I looked at the example project provided
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Solution I recieved:
- I was missing a curly brace at the bottom or I would have an extra one. In this case I didn't have 
anything in the ThisYear class, so the program was acting weird.
- This helped me format my code for my project.
- The starter code helped me start the project!
- The example project helped me figure out what methods to use.
